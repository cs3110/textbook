# Data

In this chapter, we'll examine some of OCaml's built-in data types,
including lists, variants, records, tuples, and options.  Many of
those are likely to feel familiar from other programming languages.
We'll learn about *pattern matching*, which is a feature that's
less likely to be familiar.

Then we will see how we can define our own *algebraic data types*,
and how many of OCaml's built-in data types would not have to be
built-in, but are actually definable with algebraic data types.

We'll also examine how to define data types for trees and maps using
various combinations of the above features.

Finally, we'll take brief detours into unit testing (for which we
first need to know about lists) and exceptions (for which we
first need to know about algebraic data types and pattern matching).
