    "Here are some additional pattern forms that are useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `p1 | ... | pn`: an \"or\" pattern; matching against it succeeds if a match\n",
    "  succeeds against any of the individual patterns `pi`, which are tried in order\n",
    "  from left to right. All the patterns must bind the same variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `(p : t)`: a pattern with an explicit type annotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `c`: here, `c` means any constant, such as integer literals, string literals,\n",
    "  and booleans.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `'ch1'..'ch2'`: here, `ch` means a character literal. For example, `'A'..'Z'`\n",
    "  matches any uppercase letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `p when e`: matches `p` but only if `e` evaluates to `true`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read about [all the pattern forms][patterns] in the manual.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Pattern Matching with Let\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax we've been using so far for let expressions is, in fact, a special\n",
    "case of the full syntax that OCaml permits. That syntax is:\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let p = e1 in e2\n",
    "```\n",
    "That is, the left-hand side of the binding may in fact be a pattern, not just an\n",
    "identifier. Of course, variable identifiers are on our list of valid patterns,\n",
    "so that's why the syntax we've studied so far is just a special case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this syntax, we revisit the semantics of let expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic semantics.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate `let p = e1 in e2`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluate `e1` to a value `v1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Match `v1` against pattern `p`. If it doesn't match, raise the exception\n",
    "   `Match_failure`. Otherwise, if it does match, it produces a set $b$ of\n",
    "   bindings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Substitute those bindings $b$ in `e2`, yielding a new expression `e2'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Evaluate `e2'` to a value `v2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The result of evaluating the let expression is `v2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Static semantics.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* If all the following hold then `(let p = e1 in e2) : t2`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `e1 : t1`\n",
    "\n",
    "  - the pattern variables in `p` are `x1..xn`\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `e2 : t2` under the assumption that for all `i` in `1..n` it holds that\n",
    "    `xi : ti`,\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let definitions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, a let definition can be understood as a let expression whose body has\n",
    "not yet been given. So their syntax can be generalized to\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let p = e\n",
    "```\n",
    "and their semantics follow from the semantics of let expressions, as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pattern Matching with Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax we've been using so far for functions is also a special case of the\n",
    "full syntax that OCaml permits. That syntax is:\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let f p1 ... pn = e1 in e2   (* function as part of let expression *)\n",
    "let f p1 ... pn = e          (* function definition at toplevel *)\n",
    "fun p1 ... pn -> e           (* anonymous function *)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The truly primitive syntactic form we need to care about is `fun p -> e`. Let's\n",
    "revisit the semantics of anonymous functions and their application with that\n",
    "form; the changes to the other forms follow from those below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Static semantics.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let `x1..xn` be the pattern variables appearing in `p`. If by assuming that\n",
    "  `x1 : t1` and `x2 : t2` and ... and `xn : tn`, we can conclude that `p : t`\n",
    "  and ` e : u`, then `fun p -> e : t -> u`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The type checking rule for application is unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic semantics.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The evaluation rule for anonymous functions is unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To evaluate `e0 e1`:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Evaluate `e0` to an anonymous function `fun p -> e`, and\n",
    "     evaluate `e1` to value `v1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Match `v1` against pattern `p`. If it doesn't match, raise the exception\n",
    "     `Match_failure`. Otherwise, if it does match, it produces a set $b$ of\n",
    "     bindings.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. Substitute those bindings $b$ in `e`, yielding a new expression `e'`.\n",
