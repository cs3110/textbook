    "intended), which is the dynamic semantics of how exceptions are raised and\n",
    "handled.\n",

    "\n",
    "* evaluates to a value\n",
    "\n",
    "* raises an exception\n",
    "\n",
    "* or fails to terminate (i.e., an \"infinite loop\").\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've only presented the part of the dynamic semantics that handles the\n",
    "first of those three cases. What happens when we add exceptions? Now, evaluation\n",
    "of an expression either produces a value or produces an *exception packet*.\n",
    "Packets are not normal OCaml values; the only pieces of the language that\n",
    "recognizes them are `raise` and `try`. The exception value produced by (e.g.)\n",
    "`Failure \"oops\"` is part of the exception packet produced by\n",
    "`raise (Failure \"oops\")`, but the packet contains more than just the exception\n",
    "value; there can also be a stack trace, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any expression `e` other than `try`, if evaluation of a subexpression of `e`\n",
    "produces an exception packet `P`, then evaluation of `e` produces packet `P`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But now we run into a problem for the first time: what order are subexpressions\n",
    "evaluated in? Sometimes the answer to that question is provided by the semantics\n",
    "we have already developed. For example, with let expressions, we know that the\n",
    "binding expression must be evaluated before the body expression. So the\n",
