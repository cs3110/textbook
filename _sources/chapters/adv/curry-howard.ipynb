    "\n",

    "OCaml infers (or the programmer annotates) the types of expressions. For\n",

    "Likewise, `[]` is evidence that the type `'a list` is not empty. We say that the\n",
    "type is *inhabited* if it is not empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are there empty types? There actually is one in OCaml, though we've never had\n",

    "## The Correspondence\n",
    "\n",
    "What we have just discovered is that computing with evidence corresponds to\n",
    "constructing valid logical proofs. This correspondence is not just an accident\n",
    "that occurs with these three specific programs. Rather, it is a deep phenomenon\n",
    "that links the fields of programming and logic. Aspects of it have been\n",
    "discovered by many people working in many areas. So, it goes by many names. One\n",
    "common name is *the Curry-Howard correspondence*, named for logicians Haskell\n",
    "Curry (for whom the functional programming language Haskell is named) and\n",
    "William Howard. This correspondence links ideas from programming to ideas from\n",
    "logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Types correspond to logical formulas (aka *propositions*).\n",
    "- Programs correspond to logical proofs.\n",
    "- Evaluation corresponds to simplification of proofs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen the first two of those correspondences. The types of our\n",
    "three little programs corresponded to formulas, and the programs themselves\n",
    "corresponded to the reasoning done in proofs involving conjunctions. We haven't\n",
    "seen the third yet; we will later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dig into each of the correspondences to appreciate them more fully.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types Correspond to Propositions\n",
    "\n",
    "In *propositional logic*, formulas are created with atomic propositions,\n",
    "negation, conjunction, disjunction, and implication. The following BNF describes\n",
    "propositional logic formulas:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "p ::= atom\n",
    "    | ~ p      (* negation *)\n",
    "    | p /\\ p   (* conjunction *)\n",
    "    | p \\/ p   (* disjunction *)\n",
    "    | p -> p   (* implication *)\n",
    "\n",
    "atom ::= <identifiers>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `raining /\\ snowing /\\ cold` is a proposition stating that it is\n",
    "simultaneously raining and snowing and cold (a weather condition known as\n",
    "[*Ithacating*][ithacating]). An atomic proposition might hold of the world, or\n",
    "not. There are two distinguished atomic propositions, written `true` and\n",
    "`false`, which are always hold and never hold, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "[ithacating]: https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ithacating\n",
    "\n",
    "All these *connectives* (so-called because they connect formulas together) have\n",
    "correspondences in the types of functional programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conjunction.** We have already seen that the `/\\` connective corresponds to\n",
    "the `*` type constructor. Proposition `A /\\ B` asserts the truth of both `A` and\n",
    "`B`. An OCaml value of type `a * b` contains values both of type `a` and `b`.\n",
    "Both `/\\` and `*` thus correspond to the idea of pairing or products.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implication.** The implication connective `->` corresponds to the function\n",
    "type constructor `->`. Proposition `A -> B` asserts that if you can show that\n",
    "`A` holds, then you can show that `B` holds. In other words, by assuming `A`,\n",
    "you can conclude `B`. In a sense, that means you can transform `A` into `B`. An\n",
    "OCaml value of type `a -> b` expresses that idea even more clearly. Such a value\n",
    "is a function that transforms a value of type `a` into a value of type `b`.\n",
    "Thus, if you can show that `a` is inhabited (by exhibiting a value of that\n",
    "type), you can show that `b` is inhabited (by applying the function of type\n",
    "`a -> b` to it). So, `->` corresponds to the idea of transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disjunction.** The disjunction connective `\\/` corresponds to something a\n",
    "little more difficult to express concisely in OCaml. Proposition `A \\/ B`\n",
    "asserts that either you can show `A` holds or `B` holds. Let's strengthen that\n",
    "to further assert that in addition to showing *one* of them holds, you have to\n",
    "specify *which one* you are showing. Why would that matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we were working on a proof of the *twin prime conjecture*, an unsolved\n",
    "problem that states there are infinitely many twin primes (primes of the form\n",
    "$n$ and $n+2$, such as 3 and 5, or 5 and 7). Let the atomic proposition `TP`\n",
    "denote that there are infinitely many twin primes. Then the proposition\n",
    "`TP \\/ ~ TP` seems reasonable: either there are infinitely many twin primes, or\n",
    "there aren't. We wouldn't even have to figure out how to prove the conjecture!\n",
    "But if we strengthen the meaning of `\\/` to be that we have to state *which one*\n",
    "of the sides, left or right, holds, then we would either have to give a proof or\n",
    "disproof of the conjecture. No one knows how to do that currently. So we could\n",
    "not prove `TP \\/ ~ TP`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Henceforth we will use `\\/` in that stronger sense of having to identify whether\n",
    "we are giving a proof of the left or the right side proposition. Thus, we can't\n",
    "necessarily conclude `p \\/ ~ p` for any proposition `p`: it will matter whether\n",
    "we can prove `p` or `~ p` on their own. Technically, this makes our\n",
    "propositional logic *constructive* rather than *classical*. In constructive\n",
    "logic we must construct the proof of the individual propositions. Classical\n",
    "logic (the traditional way `\\/` is understood) does not require that.\n",
