    "discovered by many people working in many areas. So, it goes by many names. One\n",
    "common name is *the Curry-Howard correspondence*, named for logicians Haskell\n",
    "Curry (for whom the functional programming language Haskell is named) and\n",
    "William Howard. This correspondence links ideas from programming to ideas from\n",
    "logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Types correspond to logical formulas (aka *propositions*).\n",
    "- Programs correspond to logical proofs.\n",
    "- Evaluation corresponds to simplification of proofs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen the first two of those correspondences. The types of our\n",
    "three little programs corresponded to formulas, and the programs themselves\n",
    "corresponded to the reasoning done in proofs involving conjunctions. We haven't\n",
    "seen the third yet; we will later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dig into each of the correspondences to appreciate them more fully.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types Correspond to Propositions\n",
    "\n",
    "In *propositional logic*, formulas are created with atomic propositions,\n",
    "negation, conjunction, disjunction, and implication. The following BNF describes\n",

    "    | p -> p   (* implication *)\n",
    "\n",
    "atom ::= <identifiers>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, `raining /\\ snowing /\\ cold` is a proposition stating that it is\n",
    "simultaneously raining and snowing and cold (a weather condition known as\n",
    "[*Ithacating*][ithacating]). An atomic proposition might hold of the world, or\n",
    "not. There are two distinguished atomic propositions, written `true` and\n",
    "`false`, which are always hold and never hold, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "[ithacating]: https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ithacating\n",
    "\n",
    "All these *connectives* (so-called because they connect formulas together) have\n",
    "correspondences in the types of functional programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conjunction.** We have already seen that the `/\\` connective corresponds to\n",
    "the `*` type constructor. Proposition `A /\\ B` asserts the truth of both `A` and\n",
    "`B`. An OCaml value of type `a * b` contains values both of type `a` and `b`.\n",
    "Both `/\\` and `*` thus correspond to the idea of pairing or products.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implication.** The implication connective `->` corresponds to the function\n",
    "type constructor `->`. Proposition `A -> B` asserts that if you can show that\n",
    "`A` holds, then you can show that `B` holds. In other words, by assuming `A`,\n",
    "you can conclude `B`. In a sense, that means you can transform `A` into `B`. An\n",
    "OCaml value of type `a -> b` expresses that idea even more clearly. Such a value\n",
    "is a function that transforms a value of type `a` into a value of type `b`.\n",
    "Thus, if you can show that `a` is inhabited (by exhibiting a value of that\n",
    "type), you can show that `b` is inhabited (by applying the function of type\n",
    "`a -> b` to it). So, `->` corresponds to the idea of transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disjunction.** The disjunction connective `\\/` corresponds to something a\n",
    "little more difficult to express concisely in OCaml. Proposition `A \\/ B`\n",
    "asserts that either you can show `A` holds or `B` holds. Let's strengthen that\n",
    "to further assert that in addition to showing *one* of them holds, you have to\n",
    "specify *which one* you are showing. Why would that matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we were working on a proof of the *twin prime conjecture*, an unsolved\n",
    "problem that states there are infinitely many twin primes (primes of the form\n",
    "$n$ and $n+2$, such as 3 and 5, or 5 and 7). Let the atomic proposition `TP`\n",

    "logic we must construct the proof of the individual propositions. Classical\n",
