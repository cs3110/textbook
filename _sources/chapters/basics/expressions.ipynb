    "imperative languages are primarily built out of *commands*, programs in\n",
    "functional languages are primarily built out of expressions. Examples of\n",
    "expressions include `2+2` and `increment 21`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OCaml manual has a complete definition of [all the expressions in the\n",
    "language][exprs]. Though that page starts with a rather cryptic overview, if you\n",
    "scroll down, you'll come to some English explanations. Don't worry about\n",
    "studying that page now; just know that it's available for reference.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The primary task of computation in a functional language is to *evaluate* an\n",
    "expression to a *value*. A value is an expression for which there is no\n",
    "computation remaining to be performed. So, all values are expressions, but not\n",
    "all expressions are values. Examples of values include `2`, `true`, and\n",

    "```\n",
    "But this is darn confusing, and for that reason, it is strongly discouraged\n",
    "style&mdash;much like ambiguous pronouns are discouraged in natural language.\n",
    "Nonetheless, let's consider what that code means.\n",
    "\n",
    "To what value does that code evaluate? The answer comes down to how `x` is\n",

    "```\n",
    "The first one is what nearly any reasonable language would do. And most likely\n",
    "it's what you would guess But, **why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is something we'll call the *Principle of Name Irrelevance*: the name\n",
    "of a variable shouldn't intrinsically matter. You're used to this from math. For\n",
    "example, the following two functions are the same:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "f(x) &= x^2 \\\\\n",
    "f(y) &= y^2\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn't intrinsically matter whether we call the argument to the function\n",
    "$x$ or $y$; either way, it's still the squaring function.\n",
    "Therefore, in programs, these two functions should be identical:\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let f x = x * x\n",
    "let f y = y * y\n",
    "```\n",
    "This principle is more commonly known as *alpha equivalence*: the two functions\n",
    "are equivalent up to renaming of variables, which is also called *alpha\n",
    "conversion* for historical reasons that are unimportant here.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Principle of Name Irrelevance, these two expressions should be\n",
    "identical:\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let x = 6 in x\n",
    "let y = 6 in y\n",
    "```\n",
    "Therefore, the following two expressions, which have the above expressions\n",
    "embedded in them, should also be identical:\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let x = 5 in (let x = 6 in x) + x\n",
    "let x = 5 in (let y = 6 in y) + x\n",
    "```\n",
    "But for those to be identical, we **must** choose the first of the three\n",
    "possibilities above. It is the only one that makes the name of the variable be\n",
    "irrelevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a term commonly used for this phenomenon: a new binding of a variable\n",
    "*shadows* any old binding of the variable name. Metaphorically, it's as if the\n",
    "new binding temporarily casts a shadow over the old binding. But eventually the\n",
    "old binding could reappear as the shadow recedes.\n",
    "\n",
    "{{ video_embed | replace(\"%%VID%%\", \"4SqMkUwakEA\")}}\n",
    "\n",
    "Shadowing is not mutable assignment. For example, both of the following\n",
    "expressions evaluate to 11:\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let x = 5 in ((let x = 6 in x) + x)\n",
    "let x = 5 in (x + (let x = 6 in x))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Likewise, the following utop transcript is not mutable assignment, though at\n",
    "first it could seem like it is:\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "# let x = 42;;\n",
    "val x : int = 42\n",
    "# let x = 22;;\n",
    "val x : int = 22\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that every `let` definition in the toplevel is effectively a nested `let`\n",
    "expression. So the above is effectively the following:\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "let x = 42 in\n",
    "  let x = 22 in\n",
    "    ... (* whatever else is typed in the toplevel *)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The right way to think about this is that the second `let` binds an entirely new\n",
    "variable that just happens to have the same name as the first `let`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is another utop transcript that is well worth studying:\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "# let x = 42;;\n",
    "val x : int = 42\n",
    "# let f y = x + y;;\n",

    "# let x = 22;;\n",
    "val x : int = 22\n",
    "# f 0;;\n",
    "- : int = 42  (* x did not mutate! *)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, each let definition binds an entirely new variable. If that new\n",
    "variable happens to have the same name as an old variable, the new variable\n",
    "temporarily shadows the old one. But the old variable is still around, and its\n",
    "value is immutable: it never, ever changes. So even though `let` expressions\n",
    "might superficially look like assignment statements from imperative languages,\n",
    "they are actually quite different.\n",

    "## Type Annotations\n",
