    "Testing provides evidence of correctness, but not full assurance. Even after\n",
    "extensive black-box and glass-box testing, maybe there's still some test case\n",
    "the programmer failed to invent, and that test case would reveal a fault in the\n",
    "program.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{epigraph}\n",
    "Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence.\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Edsger W. Dijkstra\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The point is not that testing is useless! It can be quite effective. But it is a\n",
    "kind of *inductive reasoning*, in which evidence (i.e., passing tests)\n",
    "accumulates in support of a conclusion (i.e., correctness of the program)\n",
    "without absolutely guaranteeing the validity of that conclusion. (Note that the\n",
    "word \"inductive\" here is being used in a different sense than the proof\n",
    "technique known as induction.) To get that guarantee, we turn to *deductive\n",
    "reasoning*, in which we proceed from premises and rules about logic to a valid\n",
    "conclusion. In other words, we prove the correctness of the program. Our goal,\n",
    "next, is to learn some techniques for such correctness proofs. These techniques\n",
    "are known as *formal methods* because of their use of logical formalism.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Correctness* here means that the program produces the right output\n",
    "according to a *specification*. Specifications are usually provided in the\n",
    "documentation of a function (hence the name \"specification comment\"): they\n",
    "describe the program's precondition and postcondition. Postconditions, as we\n",
    "have been writing them, have the form `[f x] is \"...a description of the output\n",
    "in terms of the input [x]...\"`. For example, the specification of a factorial\n",
    "function could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "(** [fact n] is [n!]. Requires: [n >= 0]. *)\n",
    "let rec fact n = ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The postcondition is asserting an equality between the output of the function\n",
    "and some English description of a computation on the input. *Formal\n",
    "verification* is the task for proving that the implementation of the function\n",
    "satisfies its specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equalities are one of the fundamental ways we think about correctness of\n",
    "functional programs. The absence of mutable state makes it possible to reason\n",
    "straightforwardly about whether two expressions are equal. It's difficult to do\n",

    "identity function: when they are applied to an input, they will both produce the\n",
    "same output. That is, `(fun x -> x) z = z`, and `(fun y -> y) z = z`. If it is\n",
    "the case that for all inputs two functions produce the same output, we will\n",
    "consider the functions to be equal:\n",

    "```\n",

    "Extensionality* in some branches of mathematics; henceforth we'll refer to it\n",
    "simply as \"extensionality\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will adopt the semantic approach. If `e1` and `e2` evaluate to the same\n",
