    "# Equational Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "Next let's tackle a bigger challenge: proving the correctness of a data\n",
    "structure, such as a stack, queue, or set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correctness proofs always need specifications. In proving the correctness of\n",
    "iterative factorial, we used recursive factorial as a specification. By analogy,\n",
    "we could provide two implementations of a data structure---one simple, the other\n",
    "complex and efficient---and prove that the two are equivalent. That would\n",
    "require us to introduce ways to translate between the two implementations. For\n",
    "example, we could prove the correctness of a map implemented with an efficient\n",
    "balanced binary search tree relative to an implementation as an inefficient\n",
    "association list, by defining functions to convert trees to lists. Such an\n",
    "approach is certainly valid, but it doesn't lead to new ideas about verification\n",
    "for us to study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we will pursue a different approach based on *equational\n",
    "specifications*, aka *algebraic specifications*. The idea with these is to\n",
    "\n",
    "- define the types of the data structure operations, and\n",
    "\n",
    "- to write a set of equations that define how the operations interact with one\n",
    "  another.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason the word \"algebra\" shows up here is (in part) that this\n",
    "type-and-equation based approach is something we learned in high-school algebra.\n",
    "For example, here is a specification for some operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "0 : int\n",
    "1 : int\n",
    "- : int -> int\n",
    "+ : int -> int -> int\n",
    "* : int -> int -> int\n",

    "(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)\n",
    "a + b = b + a\n",
    "a + 0 = a\n",
    "a + (-a) = 0\n",
    "(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)\n",
    "a * b = b * a\n",
    "a * 1 = a\n",
    "a * 0 = 0\n",
    "a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The types of those operators, and the associated equations, are facts learned\n",
    "when studying algebra.\n",

    "{{ video_embed | replace(\"%%VID%%\", \"8uJmKmsiF2I\")}}\n",
    "\n",
    "For both stacks and queues we provided some equations as the specification.\n",
    "Designing those equations is, in part, a matter of thinking hard about the data\n",
    "structure. But there's more to it than that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every value of the data structure is constructed with some operations. For a\n",
    "stack, those operations are `empty` and `push`. There might be some `pop`\n",
    "operations involved, but those can be eliminated. For example, `pop (push 1\n",
    "(push 2 empty))` is really the same stack as `push 2 empty`. The latter is the\n",
    "*canonical form* of that stack: there are many other ways to construct it, but\n",
    "that is the simplest. Indeed, every possible stack value can be constructed just\n",
    "with `empty` and `push`. Similarly, every possible queue value can be\n",
    "constructed just with `empty` and `enq`: if there are `deq` operations involved,\n",
    "those can be eliminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's categorize the operations of a data structure as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generators** are those operations involved in creating a canonical form.\n",
    "  They return a value of the data structure type. For example, `empty`, `push`,\n",
    "  `enq`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Manipulators** are operations that create a value of the data structure\n",
    "  type, but are not needed to create canonical forms. For example, `pop`, `deq`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Queries** do not return a value of the data structure type. For example,\n",
    "  `is_empty`, `peek`, `front`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given such a categorization, we can design the equational specification of a\n",
    "data structure by applying non-generators to generators. For example: What does\n",
    "`is_empty` return on `empty`? on `push`? What does `front` return on `enq`? What\n",
    "does `deq` return on `enq`? Etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if there are `n` generators and `m` non-generators of a data structure, we\n",
    "would begin by trying to create `n*m` equations, one for each pair of a\n",
    "generator and non-generator. Each equation would show how to simplify an\n",
    "expression. In some cases we might need a couple equations, depending on the\n",
    "result of some comparison. For example, in the queue specification, we have the\n",
    "following equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `is_empty empty = true`: this is a non-generator `is_empty` applied to a\n",
    "   generator `empty`. It reduces just to a Boolean value, which doesn't involve\n",
    "   the data structure type (queues) at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `is_empty (enq x q) = false`: a non-generator `is_empty` applied to a\n",
    "   generator `enq`. Again it reduces simply to a Boolean value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There are two subcases.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `front (enq x q) = x`, if `is_empty q = true`. A non-generator `front`\n",
    "     applied to a generator `enq`. It reduces to `x`, which is a smaller\n",
    "     expression than the original `front (enq x q)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `front (enq x q) = front q`, `if is_empty q = false`. This similarly\n",
    "     reduces to a smaller expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Again, there are two subcases.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `deq (enq x q) = empty`, if `is_empty q = true`. This simplifies the\n",
    "     original expression by reducing it to `empty`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `deq (enq x q) = enq x (deq q)`, if `is_empty q = false`. This simplifies\n",
    "     the original expression by reducing it to a generator applied to a smaller\n",
    "     argument, `deq q` instead of `deq (enq x q)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't usually design equations involving pairs of non-generators. Sometimes\n",
    "pairs of generators are needed, though, as we will see in the next example.\n",
