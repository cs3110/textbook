    "\n",
    "When writing black-box test cases, we ask ourselves what set of test cases that\n",

    "aka *corner cases* or *edge cases*. A common error is to only test typical\n",

    "specification creates classes of inputs that should elicit similar behavior from\n",
    "the function, and to test on those *paths through the specification*. Here are\n",
    "some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some ideas for how to test the `create` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Looking at the square above, we see that it has boundaries at `min_int` and\n",

    "- The line `p=0` is important because `p/q` is zero all along it. We should try\n",
    "  `(0, q)` for various values of `q`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We should try some typical `(p, q)` pairs in all four quadrants of the space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We should try both `(p, q)` pairs in which `q` divides evenly into `p`, and\n",
    "  pairs in which `q` does not divide into `p`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pairs of the form `(1, q)`, `(-1, q)`, `(p, 1)`, `(p, -1)` for various `p` and\n",
    "  `q` also may be interesting given the properties of rational numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specification also says that the code will check that `q` is not zero. We\n",
    "should construct some test cases to ensure this checking is done as advertised.\n",
    "Trying `(1, 0)`, `(max_int, 0)`, `(min_int, 0)`, `(-1, 0)`, `(0, 0)` to see that\n",
    "they all raise the specified exception would probably be an adequate set of\n",
