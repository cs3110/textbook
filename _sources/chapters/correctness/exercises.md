{{ ex3 | replace("%%NAME%%", "spec game")}}

Pair up with another programmer and play the specification game with them. Take
turns being the specifier and the devious programmer. Here are some suggested
functions you could use:

 - `num_vowels : string -> int`
 - `is_sorted : 'a list -> bool`
 - `sort : 'a list -> 'a list`
 - `max : 'a list -> 'a`
 - `is_prime : int -> bool`
 - `is_palindrome : string -> bool`
 - `second_largest : int list -> int`
 - `depth : 'a tree -> int`

{{ ex3 | replace("%%NAME%%", "poly spec")}}

Let's create a data abstraction for single-variable integer polynomials of the
form

$$
c_n x^n + \dotsb + c_1 x + c_0 .
$$

Let's assume that the polynomials are *dense*, meaning that they contain very
few coefficients that are zero. Here is an incomplete interface for polynomials:

```ocaml
(** [Poly] represents immutable polynomials with integer coefficients. *)
module type Poly = sig
  (** [t] is the type of polynomials. *)
  type t

  (** [eval x p] is [p] evaluated at [x]. Example: if [p] represents
      $3x^3 + x^2 + x$, then [eval 10 p] is [3110]. *)
  val eval : int -> t -> int
end
```

Finish the design of `Poly` by adding more operations to the interface. Consider
what operations would be useful to a client of the abstraction:

* How would they create polynomials?
* How would they combine polynomials to get new polynomials?
* How would they query a polynomial to find out what
  it represents?

Write specification comments for the operations that you invent. Keep in mind
the spec game as you write them: could a devious programmer subvert your
intentions?

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
{{ ex3 | replace("%%NAME%%", "poly impl")}}

Implement your specification of `Poly`. As part of your implementation, you will
need to choose a representation type `t`. *Hint: recalling that our polynomials
are dense might guide you in choosing a representation type that makes for an
easier implementation.*

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
{{ ex4 | replace("%%NAME%%", "interval arithmetic")}}

Specify and implement a data abstraction for [interval arithmetic][int-arith].
Be sure to include the abstraction function, representation invariant, and
`rep_ok`. Also implement a `to_string` function and a `format` that can be
installed in the top level with `#install_printer`.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
{{ ex4 | replace("%%NAME%%", "function maps")}}

Implement a map (aka dictionary) data structure with abstract type `('k, 'v) t`.
As the representation type, use `'k -> 'v`. That is, a map is represented as an
OCaml function from keys to values. Document the AF. You do not need an RI. Your
solution will make heavy use of higher-order functions. Provide at least these
values and operations: `empty`, `mem`, `find`, `add`, `remove`.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
{{ ex3 | replace("%%NAME%%", "set black box")}}

Go back to the implementation of sets with lists in the previous chapter.
Based on the specification comments of `Set`, write an OUnit test suite
for `ListSet` that does black-box testing of all its operations.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
{{ ex3 | replace("%%NAME%%", "set glass box")}}

Achieve as close to 100% code coverage with Bisect as you can for `ListSet`
and `UniqListSet`.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
{{ ex3 | replace("%%NAME%%", "random lists")}}

Use `QCheck.Gen.generate1` to generate a list whose length is between 5 and 10,
and whose elements are integers between 0 and 100. Then use
`QCheck.Gen.generate` to generate a 3-element list, each element of which is a
list of the kind you just created with `generate1`.

Then use `QCheck.make` to create an arbitrary that represents a list whose
length is between 5 and 10, and whose elements are integers between 0 and 100.
The type of your arbitrary should be `int list QCheck.arbitrary`.

Finally, create and run a QCheck test that checks whether at least one element
of an arbitrary list (of 5 to 10 elements, each between 0 and 100) is even.
You'll need to "upgrade" the `is_even` property to work on a list of integers
rather than a single integer.

Each time you run the test, recall that it will generate 100 lists and check the
property of them. If you run the test many times, you'll likely see some
successes and some failures.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
{{ ex3 | replace("%%NAME%%", "qcheck odd divisor")}}

Here is a buggy function:

```ocaml
(** [odd_divisor x] is an odd divisor of [x].
    Requires: [x >= 0]. *)
let odd_divisor x =
  if x < 3 then 1 else
    let rec search y =
      if y >= x then y  (* exceeded upper bound *)
      else if x mod y = 0 then y  (* found a divisor! *)
      else search (y + 2) (* skip evens *)
    in search 3
```

Write a QCheck test to determine whether the output of that function (on a
positive integer, per its precondition; *hint: there is an arbitrary that
generates positive integers*) is both odd and is a divisor of the input. You
will discover that there is a bug in the function. What is the smallest integer
that triggers that bug?

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
{{ ex4 | replace("%%NAME%%", "qcheck avg")}}

Here is a buggy function:

```ocaml
(** [avg [x1; ...; xn]] is [(x1 + ... + xn) / n].
     Requires: the input list is not empty. *)
let avg lst =
  let rec loop (s, n) = function
    | [] -> (s, n)
    | [ h ] -> (s + h, n + 1)
    | h1 :: h2 :: t -> if h1 = h2 then loop (s + h1, n + 1) t
      else loop (s + h1 + h2, n + 2) t
  in
  let (s, n) = loop (0, 0) lst
  in float_of_int s /. float_of_int n
```
Write a QCheck test that detects the bug. For the property that you check,
construct your own *reference implementation* of average&mdash;that is,
a less optimized version of `avg` that is obviously correct.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
{{ ex2 | replace("%%NAME%%", "exp")}}

Prove that `exp x (m + n) = exp x m * exp x n`, where

```ocaml
let rec exp x n =
  if n = 0 then 1 else x * exp x (n - 1)
```

Proceed by induction on `m`.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
{{ ex3 | replace("%%NAME%%", "fibi")}}

Prove that `forall n >= 1, fib n = fibi n (0, 1)`, where

```ocaml
let rec fib n =
  if n = 1 then 1
  else if n = 2 then 1
  else fib (n - 2) + fib (n - 1)

let rec fibi n (prev, curr) =
  if n = 1 then curr
  else fibi (n - 1) (curr, prev + curr)
```

Proceed by induction on `n`, rather than trying to apply the theorem about
converting recursion into iteration.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
{{ ex3 | replace("%%NAME%%", "expsq")}}

Prove that `expsq x n = exp x n`, where

```ocaml
let rec expsq x n =
  if n = 0 then 1
  else if n = 1 then x
  else (if n mod 2 = 0 then 1 else x) * expsq (x * x) (n / 2)
```

Proceed by *[strong induction][strong-ind]* on `n`. Function `expsq` implements
*exponentiation by repeated squaring*, which results in more efficient
computation than `exp`.

[strong-ind]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction#Complete_(strong)_induction

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
{{ ex3 | replace("%%NAME%%", "expsq simplified")}}

Redo the preceding exercise, but with this simplified version of the function.
The simplified version requires less code, but requires an additional recursive
call.

```ocaml
let rec expsq' x n =
  if n = 0 then 1
  else (if n mod 2 = 0 then 1 else x) * expsq' (x * x) (n / 2)
```

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
{{ ex2 | replace("%%NAME%%", "mult")}}

Prove that `forall n, mult n Z = Z` by induction on `n`, where:

```ocaml
let rec mult a b =
  match a with
  | Z -> Z
  | S k -> plus b (mult k b)
```

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
{{ ex2 | replace("%%NAME%%", "append nil")}}

Prove that `forall lst, lst @ [] = lst` by induction on `lst`.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
{{ ex3 | replace("%%NAME%%", "rev dist append")}}

Prove that reverse distributes over append, i.e., that
`forall lst1 lst2, rev (lst1 @ lst2) = rev lst2 @ rev lst1`, where:

```ocaml
let rec rev = function
  | [] -> []
  | h :: t -> rev t @ [h]
```

(That is, of course, an inefficient implementation of `rev`.) You will need to
choose which list to induct over. You will need the previous exercise as a
lemma, as well as the associativity of `append`, which was proved in the notes
above.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
{{ ex3 | replace("%%NAME%%", "rev involutive")}}

Prove that reverse is an involution, i.e., that
`forall lst, rev (rev lst) = lst`. Proceed by induction on `lst`. You will need
the previous exercise as a lemma.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
{{ ex3 | replace("%%NAME%%", "reflect size")}}

Prove that `forall t, size (reflect t) = size t` by induction on `t`, where:

```ocaml
let rec size = function
  | Leaf -> 0
  | Node (l, v, r) -> 1 + size l + size r

let rec reflect = function
  | Leaf -> Leaf
  | Node (l, v, r) -> Node (reflect r, v, reflect l)
```

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
{{ ex4 | replace("%%NAME%%", "fold theorem 2")}}

We proved that `fold_left` and `fold_right` yield the same results if their
function argument is associative and commutative. But that doesn't explain why
these two implementations of `concat` yield the same results, because `( ^ )` is
not commutative:

```ocaml
let concat_l lst = List.fold_left ( ^ ) "" lst
let concat_r lst = List.fold_right ( ^ ) lst ""
```

Formulate and prove a new theorem about when `fold_left` and `fold_right` yield
the same results, under the relaxed assumption that their function argument is
associative but not necessarily commutative. *Hint: make a new assumption about
the initial value of the accumulator.*

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
{{ ex4 | replace("%%NAME%%", "propositions")}}

In propositional logic, we have atomic propositions, negation, conjunction,
disjunction, and implication. For example, `raining /\ snowing /\ cold` is a
proposition stating that it is simultaneously raining and snowing and cold (a
weather condition known as *Ithacating*).

Define an OCaml type to represent propositions. Then state the induction
principle for that type.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
{{ ex3 | replace("%%NAME%%", "list spec")}}

Design an OCaml interface for lists that has `nil`, `cons`, `append`, and
`length` operations. Design the equational specification. Hint: the equations
will look strikingly like the OCaml implementations of `@` and `List.length`.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------->
{{ ex4 | replace("%%NAME%%", "bag spec")}}

A *bag* or *multiset* is like a blend of a list and a set: like a set, order
does not matter; like a list, elements may occur more than once. The number of
times an element occurs is its *multiplicity*. An element that does not occur in
the bag has multiplicity 0. Here is an OCaml signature for bags:

```ocaml
module type Bag = sig
  type 'a t
  val empty : 'a t
  val is_empty : 'a t -> bool
  val insert : 'a -> 'a t -> 'a t
  val mult : 'a -> 'a t -> int
  val remove : 'a -> 'a t -> 'a t
end
```

Categorize the operations in the `Bag` interface as generators, manipulators, or
queries. Then design an equational specification for bags. For the `remove`
operation, your specification should cause at most one occurrence of an element
to be removed. That is, the multiplicity of that value should decrease by at
most one.
