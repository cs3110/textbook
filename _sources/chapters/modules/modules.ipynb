    "\n",
    "D d = new D();\n",

    "ensure that doesn't lead to any run-time errors, of course. The methods of `D`\n",
    "have to ensure that class invariants of `C` hold, for example. So by writing\n",
    "`D extends C`, the programmer is taking on some responsibility, and in turn\n",
    "gaining some flexibility by being able to write such assignment statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is a \"subtype\"? That notion is in many ways dependent on the language.\n",
    "For a language-independent notion, we turn to Barbara Liskov. She won the Turing\n",
    "Award in 2008 in part for her work on object-oriented language design. Twenty\n",
    "years before that, she invented what is now called the *Liskov Substitution\n",
    "Principle* to explain subtyping. It says that if `S` is a subtype of `T`, then\n",
    "substituting an object of type `S` for an object of type `T` should not change\n",
    "any desirable behaviors of a program. You can see that at work in the Java\n",
    "example above, both in terms of what the language allows and what the programmer\n",
    "must guarantee.\n",
    "\n",
    "The particular flavor of subtyping in Java is called *nominal subtyping*, which\n",
    "is to say, it is based on names. In our example, `D` is a subtype of `C` just\n",
    "because of the way the names were declared. The programmer decreed that subtype\n",

    "*only* subtype relationships that exist are those that have been decreed by name\n",
    "through such uses of `extends` and `implements`.\n",

    "Now it's time to return to OCaml. Its module system also uses subtyping, with\n",
