    "class D extends C { }\n",
    "\n",
    "D d = new D();\n",

    "Subtyping is what permits the assignment of `d` to `c` on the last line of that\n",

    "therefore permits an object instantiated from `D` to be used any place where an\n",
    "object instantiated from `C` is expected. It's up to the programmer of `D` to\n",
    "ensure that doesn't lead to any run-time errors, of course. The methods of `D`\n",
    "have to ensure that class invariants of `C` hold, for example. So by writing\n",
    "`D extends C`, the programmer is taking on some responsibility, and in turn\n",
    "gaining some flexibility by being able to write such assignment statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is a \"subtype\"? That notion is in many ways dependent on the language.\n",
    "For a language-independent notion, we turn to Barbara Liskov. She won the Turing\n",
    "Award in 2008 in part for her work on object-oriented language design. Twenty\n",
    "years before that, she invented what is now called the *Liskov Substitution\n",

    "substituting an object of type `T` for an object of type `S` should not change\n",
    "any desirable behaviors of a program. You can see that at work in the Java\n",
    "example above, both in terms of what the language allows and what the programmer\n",
    "must guarantee.\n",
    "\n",
    "The particular flavor of subtyping in Java is called *nominal subtyping*, which\n",
    "is to say, it is based on names. In our example, `D` is a subtype of `C` just\n",
    "because of the way the names were declared. The programmer decreed that subtype\n",
    "relationship, and the language accepted the decree without question. Indeed the\n",
    "*only* subtype relationships that exist are those that have been decreed by name\n",
    "through such uses of `extends` and `implements`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's time to return to OCaml. Its module system also uses subtyping, with\n",
    "the same underlying intuition about the Liskov Substitution Principle. But OCaml\n",
    "uses a different flavor called *structural subtyping*. That is, it is based on\n",
    "the structure of modules rather than their names. \"Structure\" here simply means\n",
    "the definitions contained in the module. That structure is &mdash;i.e., those\n",

    "Why does OCaml complain that `z` is required but not provided? We know from the\n",

    "\n",
    "The reason for this error is that we've already supplied the type annotation\n",
    "`X` in the module expression `(M : X)`.  That causes the module expression\n",
    "to be known only at the module type `X`.  In other words, we've forgotten\n",
    "irrevocably about the existence of `z` after that annotation.  All that is\n",
    "known is that the module has items required by `X`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After all those examples, here are the static semantics of module type\n",
    "annotations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Module type annotation `(M : T)` is valid if the module type of `M` is a\n",
    "  subtype of `T`. The module type of `(M : T)` is then `T` in any further type\n",

    "\n",
    "- Module type `S` is a subtype of `T` if the set of definitions in `S` is a\n",
    "  superset of those in `T`.  Definitions in `T` are permitted to instantiate\n",
    "  type variables from `S`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"sub\" vs. \"super\" in the second rule is not a typo. Think about `T` as a set\n",
    "of module values. There could be many subtypes `S1`, `S2`, etc. of `T`, each of\n",
    "which is a set of module values, and each of those sets would be a subset of\n",
    "`T`. But, the way those sets differ from `T` and one another is by adding new\n",
    "definitions of their own. For example, a list-based stack might differ from\n",
    "`ListStack` by adding a value to keep track of the number of items on the stack.\n",
    "Another implementation might add a value to keep track of how many items have\n",
    "ever been pushed on the stack in its history. Those additional values inside the\n",
    "module make its set of definitions bigger, hence the use of \"superset\" in the\n",
    "rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `M` is just a plain old structure, its module type is whatever signature the\n",
    "compiler infers for it. But that can be restricted, as we saw above, by module\n",
    "type annotations. All of this is *static*, which is to say the decisions about\n",
    "validity are made at compile time rather than run time.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{important}\n",
    "Module type annotations therefore offer potential confusion to programmers\n",
    "accustomed to object-oriented languages, in which subtyping works differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python programmers, for example, are accustomed to so-called \"duck typing\". They\n",
    "might expect `((M : X) : Z)` to be valid, because `z` does exist at run-time in\n",
    "`M`. But in OCaml, the compile-time type of `(M : X)` has hidden `z` from view\n",
    "irrevocably.\n",
    "\n",
    "Java programmers, on the other hand, might expect that module type annotations\n",
    "work like type casts. So it might seem valid to first \"cast\" `M` to `X` then to\n",
    "`Z`. In Java such type casts are checked, as needed, at run time. But OCaml\n",
    "module type annotations are static. Once an annotation of `X` is made, there is\n",
    "no way to check at compile time what other items might exist in the\n",
    "module&mdash;that would require a run-time check, which OCaml does not permit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases it might feel as though OCaml is being too restrictive. Maybe. But\n",
    "in return for that restrictiveness, OCaml is guaranteeing an **absence of\n",
    "run-time errors** of the kind that would occur in Java or Python, whether\n",
    "because of a run-time error from a cast, or a run-time error from a missing\n",

    "In summary, if a module is given a module type, such as in\n",
    "`module M : T = struct ... end`, then there are two properties the compiler\n",
    "guarantees:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. *Signature matching:* every name declared in `T` is defined in `M` at the\n",
