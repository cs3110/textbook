    "Then suppose you type `ocamlc mods.ml` to compile it. One of the newly-created\n",

    "## Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "When compiling a file, the build system automatically figures out which other\n",

    "not as sophisticated: you have to make sure to load all the dependencies of a\n",
    "file.\n",

    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "open Mods\n",
    "let x = inc 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run `ocamlbuild -pkg ounit2 mods2.byte`, the compilation will succeed.\n",
    "You don't have to name `mods.byte` on the command line, even though `mods2.ml`\n",
    "depends on the module `Mod`. The build system is smart that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also suppose that `.ocamlinit` contains exactly the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "#directory \"_build\";;\n",
    "#require \"ounit2\";;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you restart utop and try to load `mods2.cmo`, you will get an error:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "# #load \"mods2.cmo\";;\n",
    "Error: Reference to undefined global `Mods'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that the toplevel does not automatically load the modules that\n",
    "`Mods2` depends upon. There are two ways to solve this problem.\n",
    "First, you can manually load the dependencies, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "# #load \"mods.cmo\";;\n",
    "# #load \"mods2.cmo\";;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, you could instead tell the toplevel to load `Mods2` and recursively\n",
    "to load everything it depends on:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "# #load_rec \"mods2.cmo\";;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And that is probably the better solution.\n",
    "-->\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load vs Use\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a big difference between `#load`-ing a compiled module file and\n",
    "`#use`-ing an uncompiled source file. The former loads bytecode and makes it\n",
    "available for use. For example, loading `mods.cmo` caused the `Mod` module to be\n",
    "available, and we could access its members with expressions like `Mod.b`. The\n",
    "latter (`#use`) is *textual inclusion*: it's like typing the contents of the\n",
    "file directly into the toplevel. So using `mods.ml` does **not** cause a `Mod`\n",
    "module to be available, and the definitions in the file can be accessed\n",
    "directly, e.g., `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the following interaction, we can directly refer to `b` but\n",
    "cannot use the qualified name `Mods.b`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "# #use \"mods.ml\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# b;;\n",
    "val b : string = \"bigred\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mods.b;;\n",
    "Error: Unbound module Mods\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas in this interaction the situation is reversed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "# #directory \"_build\";;\n",
    "# #load \"mods.cmo\";;\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mods.b;;\n",
    "- : string = \"bigred\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# b;;\n",
    "Error: Unbound value b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you're using the toplevel to experiment with your code, it's often\n",
    "better to work with `#load` rather than `#use`. The `#load` directive accurately\n",
    "reflects how your modules interact with each other and with the outside world."
