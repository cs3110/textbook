    "A *functional data structure* is one that does not make use of mutability.\n",
    "It's possible to build functional data structures both in functional languages\n",
    "and in imperative languages. For example, you could build\n",
    "a Java equivalent to OCaml's `list` type by creating a `Node`\n",
    "class whose fields are immutable by virtue of using\n",
    "the `const` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional data structures have the property of being *persistent*: updating the\n",
    "data structure with one of its operations does not change the existing version\n",
    "of the data structure but instead produces a new version. Both exist and both\n",
    "can still be accessed. A good language implementation will ensure that any parts\n",
    "of the data structure that are not changed by an operation will be *shared*\n",
    "between the old version and the new version. Any parts that do change will be\n",
    "*copied* so that the old version may persist. The opposite of a persistent data\n",
    "structure is an *ephemeral* data structure: changes are destructive, so that\n",
    "only one version exists at any time. Both persistent and ephemeral data\n",
    "structures can be built in both functional and imperative languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists\n",

    "The built-in singly-linked `list` data structure in OCaml is functional. We know\n",
    "that, because we've seen how to implement it with algebraic data types. It's\n",

    "`dequeue` does a single pattern match, whereas `enqueue` must traverse the\n",
    "entire list to append the new element at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a very clever way to do better on efficiency. We can use two lists to\n",
    "represent a single queue. This representation was invented by Robert Melville as\n",
    "part of his PhD dissertation at Cornell (*Asymptotic Complexity of Iterative\n",
    "Computations*, Jan 1981), which was advised by Prof. David Gries. Chris Okasaki\n",
    "(*Purely Functional Data Structures*, Cambridge University Press, 1988) calls\n",
    "these *batched queues*. Sometimes you will see this same implementation referred\n",
    "to as \"implementing a queue with two stacks\". That's because stacks and lists\n",
    "are so similar (as we've already seen) that you could rewrite `pop` as\n",
    "`List.tl`, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea has a Part A and a Part B. Part A is: we use the two lists to\n",
    "split the queue into two pieces, the *inbox* and *outbox*. When new elements are\n",
    "enqueued, we put them in the inbox. Eventually (we'll soon come to how) elements\n",
    "are transferred from the inbox to the outbox. When a dequeue is requested, that\n",
    "element is removed from the outbox; or when the front element is requested, we\n",
    "check the outbox for it. For example, if the inbox currently had `[3; 4; 5]` and\n",
    "the outbox had `[1; 2]`, then the front element would be `1`, which is the head\n",
    "of the outbox. Dequeuing would remove that element and leave the inbox with just\n",
    "`[2]`, which is the tail of the outbox. Likewise, enqueuing `6` would make the\n",
    "inbox become `[3; 4; 5; 6]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The efficiency of `front` and `dequeue` is very good so far. We just have to\n",
    "take the head or tail of the outbox, respectively, assuming it is non-empty.\n",
    "Those are constant-time operations. But the efficiency of `enqueue` is still\n",
    "bad. It's linear time, because we have to append the new element to the end of\n",
    "the list. It's too bad we have to use the append operator, which is inherently\n",
    "linear time. It would be much better if we could use cons, which is constant\n",
    "time.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here's Part B of the core idea: let's keep the inbox in reverse order.  For\n",
    "example, if we enqueued `3` then `4` then `5`, the inbox would actually\n",
    "be `[5; 4; 3]`, not `[3; 4; 5]`.  Then if `6` were enqueued next, we could\n",
    "cons it onto the beginning of the inbox, which becomes `[6; 5; 4; 3]`.  The\n",
    "queue represented by inbox `i` and outbox `o` is therefore `o @ List.rev i`.\n",
    "So `enqueue` can now always be a constant-time operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about `dequeue` (and `front`)? They're constant time too, **as long as\n",
    "the outbox is not empty.** If it's empty, we have a problem. We need to transfer\n",
    "whatever is in the inbox to the outbox at that point.  For example, if the\n",
    "outbox is empty, and the inbox is `[6; 5; 4; 3]`, then we need to switch them\n",
    "around, making the outbox be `[3; 4; 5; 6]` and the inbox be empty.  That's\n",
    "actually easy:  we just have to reverse the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we just re-introduced a linear-time operation. But with one\n",
    "crucial difference: we don't have to do that linear-time reverse on every\n",
    "`dequeue`, whereas with `ListQueue` above we had to do the linear-time append on\n",
    "every `enqueue`. Instead, we only have to do the reverse on those rare occasions\n",
    "when the outbox becomes empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "So even though in the worst case `dequeue` (and `front`) will be linear time,\n",
    "most of the time they will not be. In fact, later in this book when we study\n",
    "*amortized analysis* we will show that in the long run they can be understood as\n",
    "constant-time operations. For now, here's a piece of intuition to support that\n",
    "claim: every individual element enters the inbox once (with a cons), moves to\n",
    "the outbox once (with a pattern match then cons), and leaves the outbox once (with\n",
    "a pattern match). Each of those is constant time. So each element only ever\n",
    "experiences constant-time operations from its own perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let's move on to implementing these ideas. In the implementation, we'll\n",
    "add one more idea: the outbox always has to have an element in it, unless the\n",
    "queue is empty. In other words, if the outbox is empty, we're guaranteed the\n",
    "inbox is too. That requirement isn't necessary for batched queues, but it does\n",
    "keep the code simpler by reducing the number of times we have to check whether a\n",
    "list is empty. The tiny tradeoff is that if the queue is empty, `enqueue` now\n",
    "has to directly put an element into the outbox. No matter, that's still a\n",
    "constant-time operation."
