    "# Concurrency\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrent programs enable computations to overlap in duration, instead of being\n",
    "forced to happen sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Graphical user interfaces* (GUIs), for example, rely on concurrency to keep\n",
    "  the interface responsive while computation continues in the background.\n",
    "  Without concurrency, a GUI would \"lock up\" until the current action is\n",
    "  completed. Sometimes, because of concurrency bugs, that happens\n",
    "  anyway&mdash;and it's frustrating for the user!\n",
    "\n",
    "* A spreadsheet needs concurrency to re-compute all the cells while still\n",
    "  keeping the menus and editing capabilities available for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A web browser needs concurrency to read and render web pages incrementally as\n",
    "  new data comes in over the network, to run JavaScript programs embedded in the\n",
    "  web page, and to enable the user to navigate through the page and click on\n",
    "  hyperlinks.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Servers* are another example of applications that need concurrency. A web\n",
    "server needs to respond to many requests from clients, and clients would prefer\n",
    "not to wait. If an assignment is released in CMS, for example, you would prefer\n",
    "to be able to view that assignment at the same time as everyone else in the\n",
    "class, rather than having to \"take a number\" and wait for your number to be\n",
    "called&mdash;as at the Department of Motor Vehicles, or at an old-fashioned\n",
    "deli, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary jobs of an *operating system* (OS) is to provide concurrency.\n",
    "The OS makes it possible for many applications to be executing concurrently: a\n",
    "music player, a web browser, a code editor, etc. How does it do that? There are\n",
    "two fundamental, complementary approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interleaving:** rapidly switch back and forth between computations. For\n",
    "  example, execute the music player for 100 milliseconds, then the browser, then\n",
    "  the editor, then repeat. That makes it appear as though multiple computations\n",
    "  are occurring simultaneously, but in reality, only one is ever occurring at\n",
    "  the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parallelism:** use hardware that is capable of performing two or more\n",
    "  computations literally at the same time. Many processors these days are\n",
    "  *multicore*, meaning that they have multiple central processing units (CPUs),\n",
    "  each of which can be executing a program simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the approaches being used, concurrent programming is challenging.\n",
    "Even if there are multiple cores available for simultaneous use, there are still\n",
    "many other resources that must be shared: memory, the screen, the network\n",
    "interface, etc. Managing that sharing, especially without introducing bugs, is\n",
    "quite difficult. For example, if two programs want to communicate by using the\n",
    "computer's memory, there needs to be some agreement on when each program is\n",
    "allowed to read and write from the memory. Otherwise, for example, both programs\n",
    "might attempt to write to the same location in memory, leading to corrupted\n",
    "data. Those kinds of *race conditions*, where a program races to complete its\n",
    "operations before another program, are notoriously difficult to avoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most fundamental challenge is that concurrency makes the execution of a\n",
    "program become *nondeterministic:* the order in which operations occur cannot\n",
    "necessarily be known ahead of time. Race conditions are an example of\n",
    "nondeterminism. To program correctly in the face of nondeterminism, the\n",
    "programmer is forced to think about *all* possible orders in which operations\n",
    "might execute, and ensure that in *all* of them the program works correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purely functional programs make nondeterminism easier to reason about, because\n",
    "evaluation of an expression always returns the same value no matter what. For\n",
    "example, in the expression `(2 * 4) + (3 * 5)`, the operations can be executed\n",
    "concurrently (e.g., with the left and right products evaluated simultaneously)\n",
    "without changing the answer. Imperative programming is more problematic. For\n",
    "example, the expressions `!x` and `incr x; !x`, if executed concurrently, could\n",
    "give different results depending on which executes first.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Threads\n",
    "\n",
    "To make concurrent programming easier, computer scientists have invented many\n",
    "abstractions. One of the best known is *threads*. Abstractly, a thread is a\n",
    "single sequential computation. There can be many threads running at a time,\n",
    "either interleaved or in parallel depending on the hardware, and a *scheduler*\n",
    "handles choosing which threads are running at any given time. Scheduling can\n",
    "either be *preemptive*, meaning that the scheduler is permitted to stop a thread\n",
    "and restart it later without the thread getting a choice in the matter, or\n",
    "*cooperative*, meaning that the thread must choose to relinquish control back to\n",
    "the scheduler. The former can lead to race conditions, and the latter can lead\n",
    "to unresponsive applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, a thread is a set of values that are loaded into the\n",
    "registers of a processor.  Those values tell the processor where to find\n",
    "the next instruction to execute, where its stack and heap are located in\n",
    "memory, etc.  To implement preemption, a scheduler sets a timer in the\n",
    "hardware; when the timer goes off, the current thread is interrupted and\n",
    "the scheduler gets to run. Courses on systems programming and operating systems\n",
    "will typically cover these concepts in detail."
