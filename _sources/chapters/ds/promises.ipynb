    "# Promises\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have only considered *sequential* programs. Execution of a sequential\n",
    "program proceeds one step at a time, with no choice about which step to take\n",
    "next. Sequential programs are limited in that they are not very good at dealing\n",
    "with multiple sources of simultaneous input, and they can only execute on a\n",
    "single processor. Many modern applications are instead *concurrent*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concurrency\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrent programs enable computations to overlap in duration, instead of being\n",
    "forced to happen sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Graphical user interfaces* (GUIs), for example, rely on concurrency to keep\n",
    "  the interface responsive while computation continues in the background.\n",
    "  Without concurrency, a GUI would \"lock up\" until the current action is\n",
    "  completed. Sometimes, because of concurrency bugs, that happens\n",
    "  anyway&mdash;and it's frustrating for the user!\n",
    "\n",
    "* A spreadsheet needs concurrency to re-compute all the cells while still\n",
    "  keeping the menus and editing capabilities available for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A web browser needs concurrency to read and render web pages incrementally as\n",
    "  new data comes in over the network, to run JavaScript programs embedded in the\n",
    "  web page, and to enable the user to navigate through the page and click on\n",
    "  hyperlinks.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Servers* are another example of applications that need concurrency. A web\n",
    "server needs to respond to many requests from clients, and clients would prefer\n",
    "not to wait. If an assignment is released in CMS, for example, you would prefer\n",
    "to be able to view that assignment at the same time as everyone else in the\n",
    "class, rather than having to \"take a number\" and wait for your number to be\n",
    "called&mdash;as at the Department of Motor Vehicles, or at an old-fashioned\n",
    "deli, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the primary jobs of an *operating system* (OS) is to provide concurrency.\n",
    "The OS makes it possible for many applications to be executing concurrently: a\n",
    "music player, a web browser, a code editor, etc. How does it do that? There are\n",
    "two fundamental, complementary approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interleaving:** rapidly switch back and forth between computations. For\n",
    "  example, execute the music player for 100 milliseconds, then the browser, then\n",
    "  the editor, then repeat. That makes it appear as though multiple computations\n",
    "  are occurring simultaneously, but in reality, only one is ever occurring at\n",
    "  the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Parallelism:** use hardware that is capable of performing two or more\n",
    "  computations literally at the same time. Many processors these days are\n",
    "  *multicore*, meaning that they have multiple central processing units (CPUs),\n",
    "  each of which can be executing a program simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the approaches being used, concurrent programming is challenging.\n",
    "Even if there are multiple cores available for simultaneous use, there are still\n",
    "many other resources that must be shared: memory, the screen, the network\n",
    "interface, etc. Managing that sharing, especially without introducing bugs, is\n",
    "quite difficult. For example, if two programs want to communicate by using the\n",
    "computer's memory, there needs to be some agreement on when each program is\n",
    "allowed to read and write from the memory. Otherwise, for example, both programs\n",
    "might attempt to write to the same location in memory, leading to corrupted\n",
    "data. Those kinds of *race conditions*, where a program races to complete its\n",
    "operations before another program, are notoriously difficult to avoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most fundamental challenge is that concurrency makes the execution of a\n",
    "program become *nondeterministic:* the order in which operations occur cannot\n",
    "necessarily be known ahead of time. Race conditions are an example of\n",
    "nondeterminism. To program correctly in the face of nondeterminism, the\n",
    "programmer is forced to think about *all* possible orders in which operations\n",
    "might execute, and ensure that in *all* of them the program works correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purely functional programs make nondeterminism easier to reason about, because\n",
    "evaluation of an expression always returns the same value no matter what. For\n",
    "example, in the expression `(2 * 4) + (3 * 5)`, the operations can be executed\n",
    "concurrently (e.g., with the left and right products evaluated simultaneously)\n",
    "without changing the answer. Imperative programming is more problematic. For\n",
    "example, the expressions `!x` and `incr x; !x`, if executed concurrently, could\n",
    "give different results depending on which executes first.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Threads\n",
    "\n",
    "To make concurrent programming easier, computer scientists have invented many\n",
    "abstractions. One of the best known is *threads*. Abstractly, a thread is a\n",
    "single sequential computation. There can be many threads running at a time,\n",
    "either interleaved or in parallel depending on the hardware, and a *scheduler*\n",
    "handles choosing which threads are running at any given time. Scheduling can\n",
    "either be *preemptive*, meaning that the scheduler is permitted to stop a thread\n",
    "and restart it later without the thread getting a choice in the matter, or\n",
    "*cooperative*, meaning that the thread must choose to relinquish control back to\n",
    "the scheduler. The former can lead to race conditions, and the latter can lead\n",
    "to unresponsive applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concretely, a thread is a set of values that are loaded into the\n",
    "registers of a processor.  Those values tell the processor where to find\n",
    "the next instruction to execute, where its stack and heap are located in\n",
    "memory, etc.  To implement preemption, a scheduler sets a timer in the\n",
    "hardware; when the timer goes off, the current thread is interrupted and\n",
    "the scheduler gets to run.  CS 3410 and 4410 cover those concepts in\n",
    "detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Promises\n",
    "\n",
    "In the functional programming paradigm, one of the best known abstractions for\n",
    "concurrency is *promises*. Other names for this idea include *futures*,\n",
    "*deferreds*, and *delayeds*. All those names refer to the idea of a computation\n",
    "that is not yet finished: it has promised to eventually produce a value in the\n",
    "future, but the completion of the computation has been deferred or delayed.\n",
    "There may be many such values being computed concurrently, and when the value is\n",
    "finally available, there may be computations ready to execute that depend on the\n",
    "value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea has been widely adopted in many languages and libraries, including\n",
    "Java, JavaScript, and .NET. Indeed, modern JavaScript adds an `async` keyword\n",
    "that causes a function to return a promise, and an `await` keyword that waits\n",
    "for a promise to finish computing. There are two widely-used libraries in OCaml\n",
    "that implement promises: Async and Lwt. Async is developed by Jane Street. Lwt\n",
    "is part of the Ocsigen project, which is a web framework for OCaml.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now take a deeper look at promises in Lwt. The name of the library was an\n",
    "acronym for \"light-weight threads.\" But that was a misnomer, as the\n",
    "[GitHub page][lwt-github] admits (as of 10/22/18):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Much of the current manual refers to ... \"lightweight threads\" or\n",
    "just \"threads.\" This will be fixed in the new manual. [Lwt implements] promises,\n",
    "and has nothing to do with system or preemptive threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "So don't think of Lwt as having anything to do with threads: it really is a\n",
    "library for promises.\n",
    "\n",
    "[lwt-github]: https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lwt, a *promise* is a \n",
    "reference: a value that is permitted to\n",
    "mutate at most once. When created, it is like an empty box that contains\n",
    "nothing. We say that the promise is *pending*. Eventually the promise can be\n",
    "*fulfilled*, which is like putting something inside the box. Instead of being\n",
    "fulfilled, the promise can instead be *rejected*, in which case the box is filled\n",
    "with an exception. In either case, fulfilled or rejected, we say that the promise\n",
    "is *resolved*. Regardless of whether the promise is resolved or rejected,\n",
    "once the box is filled, its contents may never change.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we will mostly forget about concurrency. Later we'll come back and\n",
    "incorporate it. But there is one part of the design for concurrency that we need\n",
    "to address now. When we later start using functions for OS-provided concurrency,\n",
    "such as concurrent reads and writes from files, there will need to be a division\n",
    "of responsibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The client code that wants to make use of concurrency will need to *access*\n",
    "  promises: query whether they are resolved or pending, and make use of the\n",
    "  resolved values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The library and OS code that implements concurrency will need to *mutate* the\n",
    "  promise&mdash;that is, to actually fulfill or reject it. Client code does not\n",
    "  need that ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore will introduce one additional abstraction called a *resolver*.\n",
    "There will be a one-to-one association between promises and resolvers. The\n",
    "resolver for a promise will be used internally by the concurrency library but\n",
    "not revealed to clients. The clients will only get access to the promise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose the concurrency library supported an operation to\n",
    "concurrently read a string from the network. The library would implement that\n",
    "operation as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a new promise and its associated resolver. The promise is pending.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Call an OS function that will concurrently read the string then invoke the\n",
    "  resolver on that string.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Return the promise (but not resolver) to the client. The OS meanwhile\n",
    "  continues to work on reading the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might think of the resolver as being a \"private and writeable\" value used\n",
    "primarily by the library and the promise as being a \"public and read-only\" value\n",
    "used primarily by the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Making Our Own Promises\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an interface for our own Lwt-style promises. The names have been changed\n",
    "to make the interface clearer."

    "means that a promise is created, fulfilled, and its contents extracted under the\n",
    "name `s1`. The second line means the same, except that its contents are named\n",

    "composition operators (such as `bind` and `join`) to enforce an ordering. If the\n",
    "promise never becomes fulfilled (or is rejected), none of its callbacks will ever\n",
    "be run.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Lwt also supports registering functions that are run after a promise is rejected.\n",
    "`Lwt.catch` and `try%lwt` are used for this purpose. They are counterparts\n",

    "\n",
    "Once again, it's important to keep track of where the concurrency really comes\n",
    "from: the OS. There might be many asynchronous I/O operations occurring at the\n",
    "OS level. But at the OCaml level, the resolution loop is sequential, meaning\n",
    "that only one callback can ever be running at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the resolution loop never attempts to interrupt a callback. So if the\n",
    "callback goes into an infinite loop, no other callback will ever get to run.\n",
    "That makes Lwt a cooperative concurrency mechanism, rather than preemptive.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand callback resolution, let's implement it ourselves. We'll\n",
    "use the `Promise` data structure we developed earlier. To start, we add a bind\n",
    "operator to the `Promise` signature:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "module type PROMISE = sig\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "\n",
    "  (** [p >>= c] registers callback [c] with promise [p].\n",
    "      When the promise is fulfilled, the callback will be run\n",
    "      on the promises's contents.  If the promise is never\n",
    "      fulfilled, the callback will never run. *)\n",
    "  val ( >>= ) : 'a promise -> ('a -> 'b promise) -> 'b promise\n",
    "end\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's re-develop the entire `Promise` structure.  We start\n",
    "off just like before:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "module Promise : PROMISE = struct\n",
    "  type 'a state = Pending | Fulfilled of 'a | Rejected of exn\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But now to implement the representation type of promises, we use a record with\n",
    "mutable fields. The first field is the state of the promise, and it corresponds\n",
    "to the `ref` we used before. The second field is more interesting and is\n",
    "discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "  (** RI: the input may not be [Pending]. *)\n",
    "  type 'a handler = 'a state -> unit\n",
    "\n",
    "  (** RI: if [state <> Pending] then [handlers = []]. *)\n",
    "  type 'a promise = {\n",
    "    mutable state : 'a state;\n",
    "    mutable handlers : 'a handler list\n",
    "  }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A *handler* is a new abstraction: a function that takes a non-pending state. It\n",
    "will be used to fulfill and reject promises when their state is\n",
    "ready to switch away from pending. The primary use for a handler will be to run\n",
    "callbacks. As a representation invariant, we require that only pending promises\n",
    "may have handlers waiting in their list. Once the state becomes non-pending,\n",
    "i.e., either fulfilled or rejected, the handlers will all be processed and\n",
    "removed from the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helper function that enqueues a handler on a promise's handler list will be\n",
    "helpful later:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "  let enqueue\n",
    "      (handler : 'a state -> unit)\n",
    "      (promise : 'a promise) : unit\n",
    "    =\n",
    "    promise.handlers <- handler :: promise.handlers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We continue to pun resolvers and promises internally:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "  type 'a resolver = 'a promise\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we changed the representation type from a `ref` to a record,\n",
    "we have to update a few of the functions in trivial ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "  (** [write_once p s] changes the state of [p] to be [s].  If [p] and [s]\n",
    "      are both pending, that has no effect.\n",
    "      Raises: [Invalid_arg] if the state of [p] is not pending. *)\n",
    "  let write_once p s =\n",
    "    if p.state = Pending\n",
    "    then p.state <- s\n",
    "    else invalid_arg \"cannot write twice\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  let make () =\n",
    "    let p = {state = Pending; handlers = []} in\n",
    "    p, p\n",
    "\n",
    "  let return x =\n",
    "    {state = Fulfilled x; handlers = []}\n",
    "\n",
    "  let state p = p.state\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we get to the trickier parts of the implementation. To fulfill or reject a\n",
    "promise, the first thing we need to do is to call `write_once` on it, as we did\n",
    "before. Now we also need to process the handlers. Before doing so, we mutate the\n",
    "handlers list to be empty to ensure that the RI holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "  (** Requires: [st] may not be [Pending]. *)\n",
    "  let fulfill_or_reject (r : 'a resolver) (st : 'a state) =\n",
    "    assert (st <> Pending);\n",
    "    let handlers = r.handlers in\n",
    "    r.handlers <- [];\n",
    "    write_once r st;\n",
    "    List.iter (fun f -> f st) handlers\n",
    "\n",
    "  let reject r x =\n",
    "    fulfill_or_reject r (Rejected x)\n",
    "\n",
    "  let fulfill r x =\n",
    "    fulfill_or_reject r (Fulfilled x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the implementation of `>>=` is the trickiest part. First, if the\n",
    "promise is already fulfilled, let's go ahead and immediately run the callback on\n",
    "it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "  let ( >>= )\n",
    "      (input_promise : 'a promise)\n",
    "      (callback : 'a -> 'b promise) : 'b promise\n",
    "    =\n",
    "    match input_promise.state with\n",
    "    | Fulfilled x -> callback x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, if the promise is already rejected, then we return a promise\n",
    "that is rejected with the same exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "    | Rejected exc -> {state = Rejected exc; handlers = []}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, if the promise is pending, we need to do more work. \n",
    "The `bind` function needs to return a new promise. That promise will become\n",
    "fulfilled when (or if) the callback completes running, sometime in the future.\n",
    "Its contents will be whatever contents are contained within the promise that the\n",
    "callback itself returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we create a new promise and resolver\n",
    "called `output_promise` and `output_resolver`. That promise is what `bind`\n",
    "returns. Before returning it, we use a helper function `handler_of_callback`\n",
    "(described below) to transform the callback into a handler, and enqueue that\n",
    "handler on the promise. That ensures the handler will be run when the promise\n",
    "later becomes resolved:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "    | Pending ->\n",
    "      let output_promise, output_resolver = make () in\n",
    "      enqueue (handler_of_callback callback output_resolver) input_promise;\n",
    "      output_promise\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All that's left is to implement that helper function to create handlers from\n",
    "callbacks. The first two cases, below, are simple. It would violate the RI to\n",
    "call a handler on a pending state. And if the state is rejected, then the\n",
    "handler should propagate that rejection to the resolver, which causes the\n",
    "promise returned by bind to also be rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "  let handler_of_callback\n",
    "      (callback : 'a -> 'b promise)\n",
    "      (resolver : 'b resolver) : 'a handler\n",
    "    = function\n",
    "      | Pending -> failwith \"handler RI violated\"\n",
    "      | Rejected exc -> reject resolver exc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But if the state is fulfiled, then the callback provided by the user to bind\n",
    "can&mdash;at last!&mdash;be run on the contents of the fulfilled promise. Running\n",
    "the callback produces a new promise. It might already be rejected or fulfilled,\n",
    "in which case that state again propagates.\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "      | Fulfilled x ->\n",
    "        let promise = callback x in\n",
    "        match promise.state with\n",
    "        | Fulfilled y -> resolve resolver y\n",
    "        | Rejected exc -> reject resolver exc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But the promise might still be pending.  In that case, we need to enqueue\n",
    "a new handler whose purpose is to do the propagation once the result is\n",
    "available:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "        | Pending -> enqueue (handler resolver) promise\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `handler` is a new helper function that creates a very simple handler\n",
    "to do that propagation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ocaml\n",
    "  let handler (resolver : 'a resolver) : 'a handler\n",
    "    = function\n",
    "      | Pending -> failwith \"handler RI violated\"\n",
    "      | Rejected exc -> reject resolver exc\n",
    "      | Fulfilled x -> resolve resolver x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lwt implementation of `bind` follows essentially the same algorithm as we\n",
    "just implemented. Note that there is no concurrency in `bind`: as we said above,\n",
    "it's the OS that provides the concurrency.\n",
