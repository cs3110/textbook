    "A *monad* is more of a design pattern than a data structure. That is, there are\n",

    "monads.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name \"monad\" comes from the mathematical field of *category theory*, which\n",
    "studies abstractions of mathematical structures. If you ever take a PhD level\n",
    "class on programming language theory, you will likely encounter that idea in\n",

    "functional programming language that is even more pure than OCaml&mdash;that is,\n",
    "Haskell avoids side effects and imperative features even more than OCaml. But no\n",
    "practical language can do without side effects. After all, printing to the\n",

    "useful in other functional programming languages, and are even starting to\n",
    "appear in imperative languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monads are used to model *computations*. Think of a computation as being like a\n",

    "The something more is an effect that the function has as a result of being\n",

    "Both of those examples involved changing the output type of a partial function\n",

    "all the integer operations&mdash;addition, subtraction, division,\n",

    "strings. In other words, the writer monad will take care of the strings for you,\n",

    "## Example: The Lwt Monad\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, it's probably obvious that the Lwt promises library that we discussed is\n",
    "also a monad. The type `'a Lwt.t` of promises has a `return` and `bind`\n",
    "operation of the right types to be a monad:\n",

    "interface. Moreover, we know that `bind` involves registering callbacks, but\n",
    "that functionality (which as you might imagine involves maintaining collections\n",
    "of callbacks) is entirely encapsulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metaphorically, as we discussed before, the box involved here is one that starts\n",
    "out empty but eventually will be filled with a value of type `'a`. The\n",
    "\"something more\" in these computations is that values are being produced\n",
    "asynchronously, rather than immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Monad Laws\n",
    "\n",
    "Every data structure has not just a signature, but some expected behavior. For\n",
    "example, a stack has a push and a pop operation, and we expect those operations\n",
    "to satisfy certain algebraic laws.  We saw those for stacks when we studied\n",
    "equational specification:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `peek (push x s) = x`\n",
    "* `pop (push x s) = s`\n",
    "* etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A monad, though, is not just a single data structure. It's a design pattern for\n",
    "data structures. So it's impossible to write specifications of `return` and\n",
    "`>>=` for monads in general: the specifications would need to discuss the\n",
    "particular monad, like the writer monad or the Lwt monad.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, it turns out that we can write down some laws that ought to\n",
    "hold of any monad. The reason for that goes back to one of the intuitions we\n",
    "gave about monads, namely, that they represent computations that have effects.\n",
    "Consider Lwt, for example. We might register a callback C on promise X with\n",
    "`bind`. That produces a new promise Y, on which we could register another\n",
    "callback D. We expect a sequential ordering on those callbacks: C must run\n",
    "before D, because Y cannot be resolved before X.\n",
    "\n",
    "That notion of *sequential order* is part of what the monad laws stipulate. We\n",
    "will state those laws below. But first, let's pause to consider sequential order\n",
    "in imperative languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sequential Order.* In languages like Java and C, there is a semicolon that\n",
    "imposes a sequential order on statements, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "System.out.println(x);\n",
    "x++;\n",
    "System.out.println(x);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "First `x` is printed, then incremented, then printed again. The effects that\n",
    "those statements have must occur in that sequential order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine a hypothetical statement that causes no effect whatsoever. For\n",
    "example, `assert true` causes nothing to happen in Java. (Some compilers will\n",
    "completely ignore it and not even produce bytecode for it.) In most assembly\n",
    "languages, there is likewise a \"no op\" instruction whose mnemonic is usually\n",
    "`NOP` that also causes nothing to happen. (Technically, some clock cycles would\n",
    "elapse. But there wouldn't be any changes to registers or memory.) In the theory\n",
    "of programming languages, statements like this are usually called `skip`, as in,\n",
    "\"skip over me because I don't do anything interesting.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two laws that should hold of `skip` and semicolon:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `skip; s;` should behave the same as just `s;`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `s; skip;` should behave the same as just `s;`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, you can remove any occurrences of `skip`, because it has no\n",
    "effects. Mathematically, we say that `skip` is a *left identity* (the first law)\n",
    "and a *right identity* (the second law) of semicolon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imperative languages also usually have a way of grouping statements together\n",
    "into blocks. In Java and C, this is usually done with curly braces. Here is a\n",
    "law that should hold of blocks and semicolon:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `{s1; s2;} s3;` should behave the same as `s1; {s2; s3;}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the order is always `s1` then `s2` then `s3`, regardless of\n",
    "whether you group the first two statements into a block or the second two into a\n",
    "block. So you could even remove the braces and just write `s1; s2; s3;`, which\n",
    "is what we normally do anyway. Mathematically, we say that semicolon is\n",
    "*associative.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sequential Order with the Monad Laws.** The three laws above embody exactly\n",
