    "# Hash Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "The *hash table* is a widely used data structure whose performance relies upon\n",
    "mutability. The implementation of a hash table is quite involved compared to\n",
    "other data structures we've implemented so far. We'll build it up slowly, so\n",
    "that the need for and use of each piece can be appreciated.\n",
    "\n",

    "Hash tables implement the *map* data abstraction. A map binds *keys* to\n",
    "*values*. This abstraction is so useful that it goes by many other names, among\n",
    "them *associative array*, *dictionary*, and *symbol table*. We'll write maps\n",
    "abstractly (i.e, mathematically; not actually OCaml syntax) as { $k_1 : v_1,\n",
    "k_2: v_2, \\ldots, k_n : v_n$ }. Each $k : v$ is a *binding* of key $k$ to value\n",
    "$v$. Here are a couple of examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A map binding a course number to something about it: {3110 : \"Fun\", 2110 :\n",
    "  \"OO\"}.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A map binding a university name to the year it was chartered: {\"Harvard\" :\n",
    "  1636, \"Princeton\" : 1746, \"Penn\": 1740, \"Cornell\" : 1865}.\n",
    "\n",
    "The order in which the bindings are abstractly written does not matter, so the\n",
    "first example might also be written {2110 : \"OO\", 3110 : \"Fun\"}. That's why we\n",
    "use set braces&mdash;they suggest that the bindings are a set, with no ordering\n",
    "implied.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "As that notation suggests, maps and sets are very similar. Data structures that\n",
    "can implement a set can also implement a map, and vice-versa:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given a map data structure, we can treat the keys as elements of a set, and\n",
    "  simply ignore the values which the keys are bound to. This admittedly wastes a\n",
    "  little space, because we never need the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given a set data structure, we can store key&ndash;value pairs as the\n",
    "  elements. Searching for elements (hence insertion and removal) might become\n",
    "  more expensive, because the set abstraction is unlikely to support searching\n",
    "  for keys by themselves.\n",

    "Hash tables are one of the most useful data structures ever invented.\n",
    "Unfortunately, they are also one of the most misused. Code built using hash\n",
    "tables often falls far short of achievable performance. There are two reasons\n",
    "for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clients choose poor hash functions that do not distribute keys randomly over\n",
    "  buckets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hash table abstractions do not adequately specify what is required of the hash\n",
    "  function, or make it difficult to provide a good hash function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, a bad hash function can destroy our attempts at a constant running\n",
    "time. A lot of obvious hash function choices are bad. For example, if we're\n",
    "mapping names to phone numbers, then hashing each name to its length would be a\n",
    "very poor function, as would a hash function that used only the first name, or\n",
    "only the last name. We want our hash function to use all of the information in\n",
    "the key. This is a bit of an art. While hash tables are extremely effective when\n",
    "used well, all too often poor hash functions are used that sabotage performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash tables work well when the hash function looks random. If it is to look\n",
    "random, this means that any change to a key, even a small one, should change the\n",
    "bucket index in an apparently random way. If we imagine writing the bucket index\n",
    "as a binary number, a small change to the key should randomly flip the bits in\n",
    "the bucket index. This is called information *diffusion*. For example, a one-bit\n",
    "change to the key should cause every bit in the index to flip with 1/2\n",
    "probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Client vs. implementer.** As we've described it, the hash function is a single\n",
    "function that maps from the key type to a bucket index. In practice, the hash\n",
    "function is the composition of *two* functions, one provided by the client and\n",
    "one by the implementer. This is because the implementer doesn't understand the\n",
    "element type, the client doesn't know how many buckets there are, and the\n",
    "implementer probably doesn't trust the client to achieve diffusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The client function `hash_c` first converts the key into an integer hash code,\n",
    "and the implementation function `hash_i` converts the hash code into a bucket\n",
    "index. The actual hash function is the composition of these two functions. As a\n",
    "hash table designer, you need to figure out which of the client hash function\n",
    "and the implementation hash function is going to provide diffusion. If clients\n",
    "are sufficiently savvy, it makes sense to push the diffusion onto them, leaving\n",
    "the hash table implementation as simple and fast as possible. The easy way to\n",
    "accomplish this is to break the computation of the bucket index into three\n",
    "steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Serialization: Transform the key into a stream of bytes that contains all of\n",
    "    the information in the original key. Two equal keys must result in the same\n",
    "    byte stream. Two byte streams should be equal only if the keys are actually\n",
    "    equal. How to do this depends on the form of the key. If the key is a\n",
    "    string, then the stream of bytes would simply be the characters of the\n",
    "    string.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Diffusion: Map the stream of bytes into a large integer *x* in a way that\n",
    "    causes every change in the stream to affect the bits of *x* apparently\n",
    "    randomly. There is a tradeoff in performance versus randomness (and\n",
    "    security) here.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Compression: Reduce that large integer to be within the range of the\n",
    "    buckets. For example, compute the hash bucket index as *x* mod *m*. This\n",
    "    is particularly cheap if *m* is a power of two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, hash table implementations are rarely forthcoming about what they\n",
