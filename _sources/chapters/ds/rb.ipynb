    "Removing an element from a red-black tree works\n",
    "analogously. We start with a BST element removal and then do rebalancing. When\n",
    "an interior (nonleaf) node is removed, we simply splice it out if it has fewer\n",
    "than two nonleaf children; if it has two nonleaf children, we find the next\n",
    "value in the tree, which must be found inside its right child.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, balancing the trees during removal from red-black tree requires considering\n",
    "more cases. Deleting a black element from the tree creates the possibility that\n",
    "some path in the tree has too few black nodes, breaking the Global Invariant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Germane and Might invented an elegant algorithm to handle that rebalancing Their\n",
    "solution is to create \"doubly-black\" nodes that count twice in determining the\n",

    "It's easy to use a BST to implement either a map or a set ADT:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For a map, just store a binding at each node. The nodes are ordered by the\n",
    "  keys. The values are irrelevant to the ordering.\n",

    "The OCaml standard library does this for the `Map` and `Set` modules. It uses a\n",
    "balanced BST that is a variant of an AVL tree. AVL trees are balanced BSTs in\n",
    "which the height of paths is allowed to vary by at most 1. The OCaml standard\n",
    "library modifies that to allow the height to vary by at most 2. Like red-black\n",
    "trees, they achieve worst-case logarithmic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a functional map data structure, how does it compare to our\n",
    "imperative version, the hash table?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Persistence:** Our red-black trees are persistent, but hash tables are\n",
    "  ephemeral.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance:** We get guaranteed worst-case logarithmic performance with\n",
    "  red-black trees, but amortized, expected constant-time with hash tables.\n",
    "  That's somewhat hard to compare given all the modifiers involved. It's also an\n",
    "  example of a general phenomenon that persistent data structures often have to\n",
    "  pay an extra logarithmic cost over the equivalent ephemeral data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Convenience:** We have to provide an ordering function for balanced binary\n",
    "  trees, and a hash function for hash tables. Most libraries provide a default\n",
    "  hash function for convenience. But the performance of the hash table does\n",
    "  depend on that hash function truly distributing keys randomly over buckets. If\n",
    "  it doesn't, the \"expected\" part of the performance guarantee for hash tables\n",
    "  is violated. So the convenience is a double-edged sword.\n",
    "\n",
    "There isn't a clear winner here. Since the OCaml library provides both `Map` and\n",
