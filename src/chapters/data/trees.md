# Example: Trees

{{ video_embed | replace("%%VID%%", "WV9DGpRTAE0")}}

Trees are a very useful data structure. A *binary tree*, as you'll recall from
CS 2110, is a node containing a value and two children that are trees. A binary
tree can also be an empty tree, which we also use to represent the absence of a
child node.

## Representation with Tuples

Here is a definition for a binary tree data type:
```{code-cell} ocaml
type 'a tree =
| Leaf
| Node of 'a * 'a tree * 'a tree
```

A node carries a data item of type `'a` and has a left and right subtree.  A leaf
is empty.  Compare this definition to the definition of a list and notice how
similar their structure is:

```ocaml
type 'a tree =                        type 'a mylist =
  | Leaf                                | Nil
  | Node of 'a * 'a tree * 'a tree      | Cons of 'a * 'a mylist
```

The only essential difference is that `Cons` carries one sublist, whereas `Node`
carries two subtrees.

Here is code that constructs a small tree:
```{code-cell} ocaml
(* the code below constructs this tree:
         4
       /   \
      2     5
     / \   / \
    1   3 6   7
*)
let t =
  Node(4,
    Node(2,
      Node(1, Leaf, Leaf),
      Node(3, Leaf, Leaf)
    ),
    Node(5,
      Node(6, Leaf, Leaf),
      Node(7, Leaf, Leaf)
    )
  )
```

The *size* of a tree is the number of nodes in it (that is, `Node`s, not
`Leaf`s). For example, the size of tree `t` above is 7. Here is a function
`size : 'a tree -> int` that returns the number of nodes in a tree:
```
let rec size = function
  | Leaf -> 0
  | Node (_, l, r) -> 1 + size l + size r
```

## Representation with Records

Next, let's revise our tree type to use a record type to represent a tree
node. In OCaml we have to define two mutually recursive types, one to represent
a tree node, and one to represent a (possibly empty) tree:

```{code-cell} ocaml
type 'a tree =
  | Leaf
  | Node of 'a node

and 'a node = {
  value: 'a;
  left: 'a tree;
  right: 'a tree
}
```

Here's an example tree:
```{code-cell} ocaml
(* represents
      2
     / \
    1   3  *)
let t =
  Node {
    value = 2;
    left = Node {value = 1; left = Leaf; right = Leaf};
    right = Node {value = 3; left = Leaf; right = Leaf}
  }
```

We can use pattern matching to write the usual algorithms for recursively
traversing trees. For example, here is a recursive search over the tree:

```{code-cell} ocaml
(** [mem x t] is whether [x] is a value at some node in tree [t]. *)
let rec mem x = function
  | Leaf -> false
  | Node {value; left; right} -> value = x || mem x left || mem x right
```
The function name `mem` is short for "member"; the standard library often uses a
function of this name to implement a search through a collection data structure
to determine whether some element is a member of that collection.

Here's a function that computes the *preorder* traversal of a tree, in which
each node is visited before any of its children, by constructing a list in which
the values occur in the order in which they would be visited:
```{code-cell} ocaml
let rec preorder = function
  | Leaf -> []
  | Node {value; left; right} -> [value] @ preorder left @ preorder right
```
```{code-cell} ocaml
preorder t
```
Although the algorithm is beautifully clear from the code above, it takes
quadratic time on unbalanced trees because of the `@` operator.  That
problem can be solved by introducing an extra argument `acc` to accumulate
the values at each node, though at the expense of making the code less clear:
```{code-cell} ocaml
let preorder_lin t =
  let rec pre_acc acc = function
    | Leaf -> acc
    | Node {value; left; right} -> value :: (pre_acc (pre_acc acc right) left)
  in pre_acc [] t
```
The version above uses exactly one `::` operation per `Node` in the tree,
making it linear time.
