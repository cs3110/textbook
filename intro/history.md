# A Brief History of CS 3110

Once upon a time, there was a course at MIT known as 6.001 *Structure
and Interpretation of Computer Programs* (SICP).  It had a
[textbook][sicp] by the same name, and it used Scheme, a functional
programming language.  Ramin Zabih took that course as a first-year
student at MIT.  Dan Huttenlocher was one of the TAs.

**CS 212.** By Spring 1994, Huttenlocher and Zabih had both become
faculty at Cornell. Zabih inaugurated CS 212 Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs.  It was very loosely based on MIT's
SICP.  The first two times it was taught in an object-oriented version
of Scheme that one of Huttenlocher's TAs had built, and later offerings
used Dylan, another object-oriented Scheme dialect. Dexter Kozen
(Cornell PhD 1977) first taught the course in Spring 1996. The earliest
surviving online record of the course seems to be [Spring
1998][cs212-1998sp], which was taught by Greg Morrisett in Dylan.

In [Fall 1999][cs212-1999fa], the language changed to Scheme. The SICP
textbook itself wasn't required; CS 212 had its own lecture notes.  As
CS 3110 still does, that instance of CS 212 covered functional
programming, the substitution and environment models, some data
structures and algorithms, and programming language implementation.

**CS 312.** At that time, the CS curriculum had two introductory
programming courses, CS 211 Computers and Programming, and CS 212.
Students took one or the other, similar to how students today take
either CS 2110 or CS 2112.  Then they took CS 410 Data Structures. The
earliest surviving online record of CS 410 seems to be from [Spring
1998][cs410-1998sp]. It covered many data structures and algorithms not
covered by CS 212, including balanced trees and graphs, and it used Java
as the programming language. 

Depending on which course they took, CS 211 or 212, students were
entering upper-level courses with different skill sets.  After extensive
discussions, the faculty chose to make CS 211 required, to rename CS 212
into CS 312 Data Structures and Functional Programming, and to make CS 211
a prerequisite for CS 312. At the same time, CS 410 was eliminated from
the curriculum and its contents parceled out to CS 312 and CS 482
Introduction to Analysis of Algorithms. Dexter Kozen taught the final
offering of CS 410 in [Fall 1999][cs410-1999fa].  

Greg Morrisett inaugurated the new CS 312 in [Spring
2001][cs312-2001sp].  He switched from Scheme to Standard ML.  Kozen
first taught it in Fall 2001, and Andrew Myers in [Fall
2002][cs312-2002fa]. Myers began to incorporate material on modular
programming from another MIT textbook, *Program Development in Java:
Abstraction, Specification, and Object-Oriented Design* by Barbara
Liskov and John Guttag.  Huttenlocher first taught the course in Spring
2006.

**CS 3110.**
In [Fall 2008][cs3110-2008fa] two big changes came: the language
switched to OCaml, and the university switched to four-digit course
numbers. CS 312 became CS 3110.  Myers, Huttenlocher, Kozen, and
Zabih first taught the revised course in Fall 2008, Spring 2009, 
Fall 2009, and Fall 2010, respectively.  Nate Foster first
taught the course in Spring 2012; and Bob Constable and Michael George
co-taught for the first time in Fall 2013.

Michael Clarkson (Cornell PhD 2010) first taught the course in [Fall
2014][cs3110-2014fa], after having first TA'd the course as a PhD
student back in [Spring 2008][cs312-2008sp].  He began to revise the
presentation of the OCaml programming material to incorporate ideas by
Dan Grossman (Cornell PhD 2003) about a principled approach to
learning a programming language by decomposing it into syntax, dynamic,
and static semantics.  Grossman uses that approach in CSE 341
Programming Languages at the University of Washington and in his popular
[Programming Languages MOOC][pl-mooc].

In [Fall 2018][cs3110-2018fa] the compilation of this textbook began. It
synthesizes the work of over two decades of functional programming
instruction at Cornell.  In the words of the Cornell [Evening
Song][eveningsong],

>'Tis an echo from the walls<br/>
>Of our own, our fair Cornell.
